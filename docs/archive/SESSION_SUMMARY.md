# Session Summary: Path to Self-Hosting

**Date**: October 29, 2024
**Duration**: Single session
**Goal**: Implement foundational features for Chronos self-hosting

---

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

We successfully implemented **Phase 0** of the self-hosting roadmap, completing TWO critical features:

### 1. ✅ Structs (Complete Implementation)
### 2. ✅ malloc/free (Dynamic Memory)

These are the **foundational building blocks** needed to write a compiler in Chronos.

---

## 📊 What Was Built

### Feature 1: Structs

**Implementation**:
- Modified `compiler/bootstrap-c/chronos_v10.c`
- Added `AST_FIELD_ASSIGN` node type
- Enhanced parser to recognize struct types
- Implemented field access codegen
- Implemented field assignment codegen

**Code Changes**: ~150 lines

**Capabilities**:
```chronos
struct Token {
    type: i32,
    line: i32
}

fn main() -> i32 {
    // Declaration
    let tok: Token;

    // Assignment
    tok.type = 1;
    tok.line = 10;

    // Access
    print_int(tok.type);

    // Literals
    let tok2 = Token { type: 2, line: 20 };

    return 0;
}
```

**Tests Created**:
- `tests/test_struct.ch` ✅
- `tests/test_struct_point.ch` ✅
- `tests/test_struct_math.ch` ✅
- `examples/structs_complete.ch` ✅

---

### Feature 2: malloc/free

**Implementation**:
- Added `malloc()` built-in using mmap syscall (9)
- Added `free()` built-in (placeholder)
- Uses: `PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE`, `MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS`

**Code Changes**: ~40 lines

**Capabilities**:
```chronos
fn main() -> i32 {
    // Allocate memory
    let ptr = malloc(1024);

    if (ptr == 0) {
        println("malloc failed");
        return 1;
    }

    // Use memory...

    // Free memory
    free(ptr);

    return 0;
}
```

**Tests Created**:
- `tests/test_malloc_simple.ch` ✅
- `tests/test_malloc_struct.ch` ✅
- `examples/dynamic_token_array.ch` ✅

---

## 🚀 What This Enables

### Before Today:
❌ No user-defined types
❌ No dynamic memory
❌ Could only use stack arrays
❌ **Cannot write a compiler**

### After Today:
✅ Structs with fields
✅ Dynamic memory allocation
✅ Can build linked data structures
✅ **CAN write a compiler!**

### Concrete Example - Lexer Token Storage:

```chronos
struct Token {
    type: i32,
    start: *i8,
    length: i32,
    line: i32,
    column: i32
}

fn lexer_tokenize(source: *i8) -> *Token {
    let capacity = 100;
    let token_size = 40;  // 5 fields * 8 bytes
    let tokens = malloc(capacity * token_size);

    // Now we can store tokens dynamically!
    // This is EXACTLY what the lexer needs!

    return tokens;
}
```

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Structs Implementation

**Parser Changes**:
- `parse_type()` - Recognizes struct names as types
- `parse_stmt()` - Handles `let p: Point;`
- Added field assignment parsing

**Codegen Changes**:
- `gen_stmt()` - Allocates struct locals on stack
- `gen_expr()` - Generates field access code
- `gen_expr()` - Generates field assignment code
- Uses `typetab_field_offset()` for offset calculation

**Memory Layout**:
```
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }

Stack layout:
[rbp-16]  ← Point.y (8 bytes)
[rbp-8]   ← Point.x (8 bytes)
[rbp]     ← base pointer
```

### malloc Implementation

**System Call**: mmap (9)

**Parameters**:
```
rdi = 0           (addr: let kernel choose)
rsi = size        (length to allocate)
rdx = 3           (PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE)
r10 = 34          (MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS = 0x22)
r8  = -1          (fd: no file)
r9  = 0           (offset: 0)
rax = 9           (syscall number)
```

**Returns**: Pointer in `rax` (or -1/0 on error)

**Characteristics**:
- Zero-initialized by kernel
- Minimum 4KB pages
- No reuse (bump allocator)
- Sufficient for bootstrap

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Structs Are Powerful
Having structs immediately makes Chronos feel like a real systems language:
- Can model domain concepts (Token, AstNode, Symbol)
- Clear memory layout
- Type-safe field access

### 2. malloc Changes Everything
Dynamic memory transforms what's possible:
- Can build trees, lists, hash tables
- Can grow data structures
- Essential for any non-trivial program

### 3. Self-Hosting Is Achievable
With structs + malloc, we have everything needed for a compiler:
- Token arrays → lexer
- AST nodes → parser
- Symbol tables → type checker
- Code buffers → codegen

### 4. Iterative Development Works
Building one feature at a time, testing thoroughly:
- Structs first (no malloc needed for testing)
- malloc second (builds on structs)
- Each feature unlocks the next

## 🔥 Highlights

**Most Exciting Moment**:
```chronos
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }

fn main() -> i32 {
    let p: Point;
    p.x = 10;
    p.y = 20;
    print_int(p.x);  // IT WORKS! 🎉
    return 0;
}
```

**Second Most Exciting**:
```chronos
let tokens = malloc(capacity * token_size);
// Can now build dynamic compiler data structures! 🚀
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Basic malloc (mmap) is enough for bootstrap
2. **Test Early**: Each feature tested immediately
3. **Document As You Go**: Easier than doing it later
4. **Incremental Progress**: Small steps → big results
5. **Trust The Process**: Self-hosting seemed far, now feels close

## 🚀 Closing Thoughts

**We're at a turning point.**

Before today, Chronos was a toy language - interesting, but limited. Stack-only memory, no user types, no way to build complex programs.

Today, Chronos became a **real systems programming language**.

With structs and malloc, we can now:
- Build compilers
- Create data structures
- Write system utilities
- Implement algorithms

**Self-hosting is no longer a dream - it's an engineering problem with a clear path forward.**

Next stop: Lexer in Chronos. Then parser. Then the whole compiler.

**The future is written in Chronos.** 🔥
